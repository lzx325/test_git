%X A major open problem on the road to artificial intelligence is the 
development of incrementally learning systems that learn about more and 
more concepts over time from a stream of data. In this work, we 
introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a 
class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of 
classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added 
progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation 
simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were 
fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore 
incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on 
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many 
classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies 
quickly fail.
